# Srhuman's Balatro Mod Loader (Refined)

I have improved my mod loader, I will be adding a better description shortly

It now injects automatically into the .EXE, but I have made the code alot messier doing so

## Instructions:

1. Install lovely(https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector)
2. Make sure you have that set up correctly, you can check if you did it correctly by checking if %appdata%\Roaming\Balatro\Mods exists
3. Download the repo, and extract the modmanager folder inside of Roaming/Balatro/Mods (make sure the contents are still inside the modmanager folder, so it should be Mods/modmanager not Mods/(all of the file contents))
4. After this you can just run the game and it should work, if not or you catch any other bugs please report them here!

### I will add more stuff here shortly, Sorry for the vague information
